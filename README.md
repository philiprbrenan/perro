# Create a 3d representation of a dog built from 2d slices.

Each slice is manually extracted from a photo by clicking along the edge of 
each slice using [program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program) **cordinates2.pl**.

The 2d representations are represented as [Scalar Vector Graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics) files which can be displayed in 
any  [web browser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser).  The 2d representations are used to scale and transform the 
slices so that the align with the cordinates axes and have matching sizes using 
**createSlices.pl**.

These slices can then be loaded into [FreeCad](https://www.freecad.org/) to 
position them to construct the 3d representation of the dog.
